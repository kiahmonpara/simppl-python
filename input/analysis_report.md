### Key Themes
Here are 5 key themes/topics that emerge from the Reddit post titles:

1.  **Anarchism and Related Political Ideologies:** This is a dominant theme, evident in posts about anarcho-nihilism, German and US anarchism, anarchist collectives, and punk's relation to anarchist education.  The discussion of social ecology, anti-Stalinism, and even the focus on mutual aid further reinforces this theme.

2.  **Social Justice and Protest:** Several posts focus on activism, resistance, and specific social justice issues. Examples include protesting TERFs, Palestinian solidarity, commentary on George Washington's history, and the encouragement of mask wearing during COVID in support of liberation.  This theme also includes the discussion of counter-protest tactics and finding local protests.

3.  **Critique of Power Structures/Authority:**  This is a more general theme but is definitely present. Posts about not paying taxes or student loans, questioning war, and sabotage directly challenge the authority of the state and financial institutions.  The naturalization of nationalism is also under consideration.

4.  **War and Conflict:** Several posts deal directly with the topic of war, either in the present ("WE DONT WANT YOUR FUCKING WAR," "Will there be partisan groups in future wars?") or in the past (discussion of George Washington's actions against Native Americans, alternative history that may involve conflict).

5.  **Education and Intellectual Discourse:** This theme covers the more academic or informational aspects, including book discussions ("What Are You Reading"), recommendations for intellectual debate content, and general discussions ("So hear me out").

### Content Depth
Let's analyze the depth and substance of these Reddit posts individually:

**Post 1: What you are reading, watching, or listening to? Or how far have you gotten in your chosen selection since last week?**

*   **Depth:** This post is shallow in terms of offering specific intellectual depth. It's primarily about sharing current media consumption. The depth would depend entirely on the responses. If people mention complex books and provide insightful commentary, the thread could gain depth.
*   **Substance:** Its substance lies in community engagement and sharing. It's a prompt designed to foster conversation and introduce people to new media based on others' recommendations.
*   **Overall:** It's a simple, open-ended invitation for discussion. Its value is in the potential for diverse responses.

**Post 2: I am an anarcho-nihilist and i am reading similar type of books for a long time. Many of the authors i read, had really close connection with these ideology. But i am wondering who is the most popular anarcho-nihilist based on historical events?**

*   **Depth:** This post reveals a specific intellectual interest in anarcho-nihilism. The question itself suggests a desire for deeper historical understanding of the ideology. It seeks to identify key figures and their impact.
*   **Substance:** The substance lies in the pursuit of knowledge within a specific philosophical framework. It provides a clear question that invites informative responses, potentially drawing on historical and philosophical expertise.
*   **Overall:** This post has more depth than the first because it demonstrates a focused interest and seeks concrete information. The quality of responses will determine its ultimate value.

**Post 3: Ayo, im an anarchist but perhaps not the most well read one though I’m working on it. I live abroad right now but I’m from the USA and it’s hard not being able to participate in direct action for the USA out here, I don’t have the financial means to donate. So it has crossed my mind to protest by no longer paying a cent to federal student loans. I have also considered taxes as well as we are are in tax season. I don’t know though if these are good ideas. I haven’t seen it brought up yet and I...**

*   **Depth:** This post delves into a moral and practical dilemma. It explores the complexities of enacting anarchist ideals within the constraints of personal circumstances (living abroad, limited finances). The internal conflict ("are these good ideas?") suggests a degree of self-reflection and awareness of potential consequences.
*   **Substance:** The substance is a consideration of potential protest actions – specifically, refusing to pay student loans or taxes. It seeks advice and validation (or counterarguments) regarding the feasibility and ethical implications of these actions. The open-ended question implies a willingness to engage in a thoughtful discussion.
*   **Overall:** This post has significant depth because it grapples with the real-world application of anarchist principles. It's not just theoretical; it's about making tangible choices. The internal conflict and request for feedback add to its substance.

**Post 4: Looking for videos/podcasts/writing where folks with anarchist philosophies debate neoliberals and other folks in the political spectrum. Ideally I’d look for debates/panels that seem well matched, paint different sides in the best light possible through strong speakers/debaters. Not looking for clickbait YouTube debate content if possible. Thanks!**

*   **Depth:** This post indicates an interest in intellectual engagement and critical thinking. The user is seeking structured debates, not just superficial arguments or propaganda. The desire for "well-matched" debaters and balanced representation suggests a desire for genuine understanding of different perspectives.
*   **Substance:** The substance lies in the search for specific resources that facilitate intellectual exploration. The post's specificity ("videos/podcasts/writing," "well-matched," "not clickbait") demonstrates a clear objective.
*   **Overall:** This post exhibits good depth. The request is for something more than a simple opinion; it's for curated, intellectually rigorous content. The rejection of "clickbait" content indicates a desire for thoughtful engagement.

**Comparative Summary:**

*   **Post 1** is the shallowest, serving primarily as a conversation starter.
*   **Post 2** shows a specific intellectual interest and a desire for historical knowledge, offering more depth than the first.
*   **Post 3** is the most personally and ethically complex, exploring the practical challenges of living by anarchist principles.
*   **Post 4** showcases a desire for intellectual engagement and critical thinking, requesting specific resources that offer well-matched debates and balanced representation.

In conclusion, the posts vary significantly in depth and substance. Posts 3 and 4 exhibit the most depth due to their engagement with complex ideas and specific intellectual desires. Post 2 displays a solid understanding and quest for information, while Post 1 serves primarily as an open invitation for discussion. The perceived depth and substance will ultimately depend on the quality of the responses each post receives.
